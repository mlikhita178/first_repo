git init -> set up a local git first_repo

git clone https://github.com/mlikhita178/first_repo.git first_repo -> clone a repo, will get a folder

cd first_repo -> after cloning, we have to go into the first_repo folder for git commands to work

git branch sub_branch_1 -> to create a new branch apart from main, main should never be used directly

upload files, do changes and all

git add <file_path> or git add * -> stage the changes in our (local) system

git commit -m "<commit message>" -> to commit/save into out (local) system. 
Still these changes do not reflect in the remote / actual git repo online

Should generate a access token in order to push changes into the remote repo

git push origin sub_branch_1 -> to push this local branch into remote / online git repo (denoted by default as origin)

git pull origin sub_branch_1 -> to pull a branch from remote repo(denoted by default as origin)
